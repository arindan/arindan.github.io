## 1. Codes for snow/glacier turbulent heat flux calculation (and SEB model, sublimation, etc) from weather station data <br />
Link: [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6804947), [GitHub](https://github.com/arindan/Winter-sublimation-at-the-Chhota-Shigri-Glacier-India)<br />

Note: Most of the codes (including SEB model) are written in R programming language. Some of the figures in the [Paper](https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/16/3775/2022/), are developed in Python. All codes are available in the repository linked above.
