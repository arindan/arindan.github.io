Hi! I'm Arindan. Thank you for visiting my webpage. 

I study glaciers and climate in the Himalayan region. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Indian Institute of Science](http://www.icwar.iisc.ac.in/), Bangalore. I have a PhD degree in Glaciology (Environmental Sciences) from Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, where I studied how local meteorology influences glacier mass balance.

One of my favourite topics is the surface energy interaction of glacier, snow, or debris surfaces and atmospheric drivers of glacier mass balance. I am particularly curious about how turbulent heat fluxes modulate glacier surface mass balance in the dry-arid Himalayan region, such as Ladakh and Karakoram.

Glacier fieldwork in the Himalayan region has offered me with some of the most gorgeous landscapes of the nature, mountain communities, and cultures. Thus, I love going to the mountains and experiencing the extremes of mountain life. I also enjoy playing badminton. 

I maintain a [glacier mass balance tracker](https://arindan.github.io/HMA_MB_Tracker/) that covers nearly all monitored glaciers in High Mountain Asia (HMA). This tracker allows users to explore the locations of these glaciers in HMA and interactively visualize their mass balance time series.
